                    <h5>Have you ever wanted to send confidential information within your work environment, to family or friends, but were afraid to do so over the internet, because some malicious hacker could be spying on you?</h5>

                    <h5>Just write your note, and you'll get a link. Then you copy and paste that link into an email (or instant message) that you send to the person who you want to read the note. When that person clicks the link for the first time, they will see the note in their browser and the note will automatically self-destruct; which means no one (even that very same person) can read the note again. The link won't work anymore.</h5>
            
                    <h5>Here's how this works</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You set the title of the note</li>
                        <li>You set how many reads are allowed</li>
                        <li>You set any time of expiry</li>
                        <li>You set the amount of reads as well as expiry time on the same note</li>
                        <li>Note is not destroyed if the person enters a wrong password</li>
                    </ul>
